{"name":"Php-maven","tagline":"A maven plugin for dependency management and quality assurance for PHP projects.","body":"## Welcome to PHP-Maven\r\nPHP-Maven uses the power of Maven 3 for building, reporting on and creating documentations of PHP projects. It adapts the Maven build lifecycle to the PHP world while fully supporting PHP 5. PHP-Maven uses PHPUnit for unit testing and phpDocumentor for creating the project documentation.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nYou should first get a working maven 3 installation. All additional stuff will be handled by [maven](http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi) itself. \r\n\r\nAs soon as you are able to invoke maven (command line mvn) everything will be fine. Before using maven for php you must tell maven where to find it. Have a look at the prepare page.\r\n\r\nNow that's it. There is no additional setup needed. Maven will now find maven for php and it will find all the nice modules already being created and uploaded to the repository.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with PHP for Maven.
